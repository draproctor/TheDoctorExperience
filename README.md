# TheDoctorExperience

This is a module that I use to customize my PowerShell experience. It contains a series of functions that I've used to simplify my work, along with anything else I figured out and wanted to save for long term records. There are a few utilities that I use near daily, such as `Get-EmailString`. 

Since I mostly work with Exchange and Exchange Online, many of the functions are geared around these products.
